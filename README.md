Developed a web application using Django and HTML that allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) recipes. Users can sign up, log in, and share recipes with friends and family — fostering a sense of community and collaboration. Implemented user authentication, database integration, and responsive web design, providing a complete full-stack web development experience.

The Recipe Sharing App showcases practical web development skills using Django’s Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture, emphasizing clean code, usability, and structured backend logic.
